# Billboard Detection System - TechNova Competition

## Project Overview
A comprehensive tech-enabled framework to detect, verify, and flag unauthorized billboards using AI, computer vision, geotagging, and citizen reporting.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### System Components
1. **Mobile App** (React Native) - Primary detection interface
2. **AI Detection Service** (Python/FastAPI) - Computer vision and ML models
3. **Backend API** (Node.js/Express) - Core business logic and data management
4. **Web Dashboard** (React) - Admin interface and public reporting portal
5. **Database** (PostgreSQL + Redis) - Data storage and caching

## 📱 Core Features

### Detection Capabilities
- **Image/Video Analysis**: Real-time billboard detection and analysis
- **Size & Dimension Validation**: Automated measurement against regulations
- **Location Compliance**: Geofencing and proximity checks
- **Content Analysis**: Inappropriate content detection
- **Structural Assessment**: Hazard identification

### Citizen Engagement
- **Easy Reporting**: One-click photo capture and submission
- **Gamification**: Leaderboards and reward systems
- **Real-time Feedback**: Instant violation flagging
- **Community Dashboard**: Public heatmaps and statistics
